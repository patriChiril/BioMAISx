## Annotation

Annotation has been carried out over the past year by two expert annotators and two separate cohorts of paid research assistants at the University of Chicago. Annotation was done according to the interfaces in the interfaces directory and the instructions in `ABSA Guidelines V4.docx`.

Annotators used LabelStudio.
